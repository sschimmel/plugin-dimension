# macro-dimension

A [freesewing](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing) 
macro to add dimensions to your (paperless) patterns.

## Install

Install this macro from NPM: 

```sh
npm install @freesewing/macro-dimension --save
```

## Loading the macro

To load this macro, add it to your instantiated pattern:

```js
import pattern from '@freesewing/pattern-brian'
import theme from '@freesewing/plugin-theme'
import dimension from '@freesewing/macro-dimension'

pattern.with(theme).with(dimension);
```

You now have the following macros available:

Name      | Description                                        
----------|-----------------------------------------------------
`hd`      | Adds a horizontal dimension
`vd`      | Adds a vertical dimension 
`ld`      | Adds a linear dimension 
`pd`      | Adds a dimension that follows a path
 
You can use them as such:

```sh
macro('<name>', {<options>});
```

## Parameters

As all freesewing macros, all options needs to be passed as a single object.

### hd

```js
part.macro('hd', {
  from: points.cbNeck
, to: points.cbHips,
  y: points.cbHips + 15
});
```
 - `from` : A point object 
 - `to` : A point object
 - `y` : The y-value at which to place the dimension

### vd

```js
part.macro('vd', {
  from: points.cbNeck
, to: points.cbHips,
  x: points.cbHips + 15
});
```
 - `from` : A point object 
 - `to` : A point object
 - `x` : The x-value at which to place the dimension

As all freesewing macros, bundle these parameters into a single object.

### ld

```js
part.macro('ld', {
  from: points.cbNeck
, to: points.cbHips,
  d: 15
});
```
 - `from` : A point object 
 - `to` : A point object
 - `d` : The distance by which to offset the dimension from the line between from and to

As all freesewing macros, bundle these parameters into a single object.

### pd

```js
part.macro('pd', {
  path: new path().move(points.cbNeck).curve(points.cbNeckCp1, points.cbNeckCp2,  points.cbHips),
  d: 15
});
```
 - `path` : A path object 
 - `d` : The distance by which to offset the dimension from the path

As all freesewing macros, bundle these parameters into a single object.
